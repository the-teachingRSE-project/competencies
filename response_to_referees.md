## R1.1: Scope

> Scope: How large is the scope of this paper?
> Is it meant to encompass RSEs around the globe or focused primarily on European RSEs?
> Also is it meant to be aspirational (e.g., all RSEs should have these)
> or does it represent the current state of RSEs (e.g., most RSEs already have these competencies)?

We acknowledge that the scope and the perspective might be confusing in parts.
We have extended the abstract and the introduction to clarify that
the foundational competencies are based on what is often encountered in Germany and beyond,
while aiming to be guidelines for aspiring RSEs.
We have also clarified that our recommendations draw from experiences in Germany, Europe, and the US,
but are not specific to a particular region.

## R1.2: Related work

> - Section 2 (Related Work):
>    - Related to scope question: If this is intended to be more widespread, I recommend including references to
>      INTERSECT (https://intersect-training.org),
>      BSSw (https://bssw.io), and
>      IDEAS-productivity (https://ideas-productivity.org)

We have now added these examples from the USA, which we previously missed. Thank you for reporting these blind spots!

## R2.XXX: Indentation of the bullet points after “Research skills” seems to be broken.

Thanks for the feedback, We fixed the indentation in 5.4.1. While at it, we also regenerated the table of contents for F1000.

## R1.ZZZ

We thank the reviewer for their feedback! In more detail:
"Section 4.1.2 - there are multiple research software maturity models/frameworks that have been proposed that adapt SWLC. See, for example, M. R. Mundt, W. Burgess and D. M. Vigil, "A Tiered Approach to Scientific Software Quality Practices," in Proceedings of the 2022 Improving Scientific Software Conference (No. NCAR/TN-574+PROC). doi:10.5065/98kd-b491"
- We thank the reviewer for this reference and augmented the section on the software life cycle with it.
 
"Section 4.1.5 - I recommend adding a note here for "as applicable," e.g., some RSEs at some institutions may not be able to share code publicly because of security or institutional requirements (though they should still use whatever they can for version controlling)
Section 4.2.4 - Similar note to 4.1.5; there should be something about "adhering to institutional policies" as well"
- We qualified it in both sections accordingly.

"Section 4.4 (Tasks and Responsibilities) - When talking about RSE communities, it might be worth it to reference some of them, e.g., UK-RSE / Soc RSE, deRSE, US-RSE, RSE-AUNZ, RSE Asia, RSSE Africa, etc."
- We thank the referee for this suggestion, and we took then the opportunity to link to the overview page of
the international RSE council, which lists all national groups, and thereby also will be updated in the future.
