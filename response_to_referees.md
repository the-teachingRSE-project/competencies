## R1.1: Scope

> Scope: How large is the scope of this paper?
> Is it meant to encompass RSEs around the globe or focused primarily on European RSEs?
> Also is it meant to be aspirational (e.g., all RSEs should have these)
> or does it represent the current state of RSEs (e.g., most RSEs already have these competencies)?

We acknowledge that the scope and the perspective might be confusing in parts.
We have extended the abstract and the introduction to clarify that
the foundational competencies are based on what is often encountered in Germany and beyond,
while aiming to be guidelines for aspiring RSEs.
We have also clarified that our recommendations draw from experiences in Germany, Europe, and the US,
but are not specific to a particular region.

## R1.2: Related work

> - Section 2 (Related Work):
>    - Related to scope question: If this is intended to be more widespread, I recommend including references to
>      INTERSECT (https://intersect-training.org),
>      BSSw (https://bssw.io), and
>      IDEAS-productivity (https://ideas-productivity.org)

We have now added these examples from the USA, which we previously missed. Thank you for reporting these blind spots!

## Reviewer 1 Feedback: Section 3.1
>    I notice that "funding methods" is missing from these challenges; there has been a lot of discussion about unreliable funding methods for software and, as a result, RSEs (e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6886129, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470770, https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/54140648/StateOfTheNationReport2017.pdf, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071971)
>    There is also a lack of "RSEs being integrated into existing teams and having to fight that team's culture". Maybe this is too niche to bring up, but it is a challenge that has been spoken about amongst RSE circles (e.g., "How can I get an existing team to change their processes when they are so stuck in their ways?")

We thank the reviewer for his/her feedback. We now mention the funding problem in the future work section of the paper. We thank the referee for the additional references, Since we don't feel
that is a challenge that has a stronger influence on the education of an RSE than it would have for any other domain scientist.

The Integration into teams is now mentioned in the Tasks-and-Responsibilities section.

## Reviewer 1 Feedback: Section 5

### 5.2

>    I disagree with some of the claims here (e.g., license discussion for Bachelor's degree seems like too much). Generally, though, this section is nice. However...
>    Not all RSEs have PhDs. Most of them do, yes, but many RSEs who do NOT have PhDs are still wildly successful without having gained the proposed skills as PhD students. How do you address that scenario (i.e., where an RSE stops after a Bachelors, Masters, etc.?)

We agree that a full license discussion would be too much for a Bachelor's degree, we really mean a very basic awareness, e.g. that different licenses exist and may come with obligations like copyleft.
This would fit in a more general discussion around good scientific practice as a primer to a Bachelor's thesis. 
We expanded on what we mean by awareness to hopefully make this clearer.

Sections 5.2 is about RSE skills that academic researchers may need without being or ever becoming RSEs,
so this would not be the place to address this issue. We have expanded the introduction to make this distinction clearer.
However, we agree that a PhD is not (and should not be) a requirement to work as an RSE and
as hinted at in the future work section we are working on composing a curriculum for a Master's degree in RSE.

## 5.3

> Section 5.3 (Project team structures) - there is a gap here: "The single RSE on a team of not-RSEs who does not have a central RSE team connection." These do exist (sadly).

We have clarified that this type of RSE (alone in a team of non-RSEs) is also meant in the category "Individual RSE (Locally-based)".

## R2.XXX (GH: #395) Reviewer 2 Feedback: page 14 bottom
- We added a line break at the indicated position.

## R2.XXX: Indentation of the bullet points after “Research skills” seems to be broken.

Thanks for the feedback, We fixed the indentation in 5.4.1. While at it, we also regenerated the table of contents for F1000.

## R2.XXX The row “SLWC” mentions “bus factors” several times and may need explanation, or should be added to the glossary.
We checked, the bus factor is referenced in the glossary. We have used the opportunity, to include an html link to the glossary here.
