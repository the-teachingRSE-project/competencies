## R1.1: Scope

> Scope: How large is the scope of this paper?
> Is it meant to encompass RSEs around the globe or focused primarily on European RSEs?
> Also is it meant to be aspirational (e.g., all RSEs should have these)
> or does it represent the current state of RSEs (e.g., most RSEs already have these competencies)?

We acknowledge that the scope and the perspective might be confusing in parts.
We have extended the abstract and the introduction to clarify that
the foundational competencies are based on what is often encountered in Germany and beyond,
while aiming to be guidelines for aspiring RSEs.
We have also clarified that our recommendations draw from experiences in Germany, Europe, and the US,
but are not specific to a particular region.

## R1.2: Related work

> - Section 2 (Related Work):
>    - Related to scope question: If this is intended to be more widespread, I recommend including references to
>      INTERSECT (https://intersect-training.org),
>      BSSw (https://bssw.io), and
>      IDEAS-productivity (https://ideas-productivity.org)

We have now added these examples from the USA, which we previously missed. Thank you for reporting these blind spots!

## Reviewer 1 Feedback: Section 3.1
>    I notice that "funding methods" is missing from these challenges; there has been a lot of discussion about unreliable funding methods for software and, as a result, RSEs (e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6886129, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470770, https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/54140648/StateOfTheNationReport2017.pdf, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071971)
>    There is also a lack of "RSEs being integrated into existing teams and having to fight that team's culture". Maybe this is too niche to bring up, but it is a challenge that has been spoken about amongst RSE circles (e.g., "How can I get an existing team to change their processes when they are so stuck in their ways?")

We thank the reviewer for his/her feedback. We now mention the funding problem in the future work section of the paper. We thank the referee for the additional references, Since we don't feel
that is a challenge that has a stronger influence on the education of an RSE than it would have for any other domain scientist.

The Integration into teams is now mentioned in the Tasks-and-Responsibilities section.



## R2.XXX (GH: #395) Reviewer 2 Feedback: page 14 bottom
- We added a line break at the indicated position.

## R2.XXX: Indentation of the bullet points after “Research skills” seems to be broken.

Thanks for the feedback, We fixed the indentation in 5.4.1. While at it, we also regenerated the table of contents for F1000.
