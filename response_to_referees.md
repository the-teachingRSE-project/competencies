## R1.2: Related work

> - Section 2 (Related Work):
>    - Related to scope question: If this is intended to be more widespread, I recommend including references to
>      INTERSECT (https://intersect-training.org),
>      BSSw (https://bssw.io), and
>      IDEAS-productivity (https://ideas-productivity.org)

We have now added these examples from the USA, which we previously missed. Thank you for reporting these blind spots!

## R2.XXX: Indentation of the bullet points after “Research skills” seems to be broken.
- Thanks for the feedback, We fixed the indentation in 5.4.1. While at it, we also regenerated the table of contents for F1000.
