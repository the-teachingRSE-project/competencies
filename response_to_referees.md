# Response to referees

Reviews 2: Indentation of the bullet points after “Research skills” seems to be broken.
- Thanks for the feedback, We fixed the indentation in 5.4.1. While at it, we also regenerated the table of contents for F1000.

## R1: Section 3 (Values)
- add sentences to explain why these values are stated explicitly here even though many practioners will learn about these values by following the examples of their peers and mentors. 
- fixed in markdown version of the paper

## R2: Section 3(Values)
- corrupted sentence is fixed in markdown version of the paper
- changed "RSEs also adhere to the SE Code of Ethics..." to "RSEs also need to adhere to..." to indicate that this is an aspiration
