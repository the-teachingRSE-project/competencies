# Response to referees

Reviews 2: Indentation of the bullet points after “Research skills” seems to be broken.
- Thanks for the feedback, We fixed the indentation in 5.4.1. While at it, we also regenerated the table of contents for F1000.

## R1: Section 3 (Values)
- we agree with the reviewer taht many RSEs are probably unaware of these code of conducts. However we feel that this is an important aspect for RSEs going forward. They will need at least some basic familiarity with to support their future work.
- add sentences to explain why these values are stated explicitly here even though many practioners will learn about these values by following the examples of their peers and mentors. 
- fixed in markdown version of the paper

## R2: Section 3(Values)
- corrupted sentence is fixed in markdown version of the paper
- changed "RSEs also adhere to the SE Code of Ethics..." to "RSEs also need to adhere to..." to indicate that this is an aspiration
