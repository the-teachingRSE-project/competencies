## R1.1: Scope

> Scope: How large is the scope of this paper?
> Is it meant to encompass RSEs around the globe or focused primarily on European RSEs?
> Also is it meant to be aspirational (e.g., all RSEs should have these)
> or does it represent the current state of RSEs (e.g., most RSEs already have these competencies)?

We acknowledge that the scope and the perspective might be confusing in parts.
We have extended the abstract and the introduction to clarify that
the foundational competencies are based on what is often encountered in Germany and beyond,
while aiming to be guidelines for aspiring RSEs.
We have also clarified that our recommendations draw from experiences in Germany, Europe, and the US,
but are not specific to a particular region.

We have now added these examples from the USA, which we previously missed. Thank you for reporting these blind spots!
