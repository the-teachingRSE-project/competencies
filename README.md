It started all at a workshop at deRSE23 in Paderborn where the community came together to discuss what to teach to future RSEs
and in which institutions to bring up the next generation of RSEs.

As we discovered, the scope of this task is so big that 
we had to split the paper in different subpapers highlighting different aspects

## How to contribute - Some of our rules

This paper is intended as a collaborative effort and we are looking for input from you.

**We follow GitLab/GitHub flow**

**Please utilise semantic line breaks!**

**We use British English**

**We have regular meetings, out meeting notes can be found here: https://pad.gwdg.de/s/pVBQ3Sh7Z#**

**If you want to get notified of our calls, and participate in the discussion by E-Mail, we have a Mailing-List: https://lists.uni-wuerzburg.de/mailman/listinfo/teachingrse**

- competencies.md will be published on arxiv. LaTeX tags/code is fine in here.
- survey.md will move to a website, hence this file has to be Markdown
- We utilise tags to categorise issues and PRs to the respective paper.

You can contribute in various ways:

1. Propose content/text via pull request
1. Improve existing content via pull request
1. Review or comment on pull requests of others

To build the PDF files, we recommend a full TeXlive installation.
You will also need to install a few Python packages:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```
If the creation of the pdf fails with an error `"Cannot understand pandocversion"`, this is caused by a bug in the Pandoc extension [pandoc-xnos](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos). If you have installed pandoc-xnos in a virtual environment, you can fix this bug by running

``` sh
make patch_pandocxnos
```

### Bibliography

We use a single, shared BibTeX bibliography file for all papers in the teaching RSE project.
This is imported as a git submodule from [another repository](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/bibliography).
See the instructions in that repository if you need to add bibliography entries.

When you first clone this repository, the bibtex folder is empty.
To download the bibliography, run the following commands:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
git config --local submodule.recurse true
```

This will populate the folder with the contents of the remote bibliography repository.
To modify the bibliography, you need to clone
[the-teachingRSE-project/bibliography](https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/bibliography),
commit your changes and push them. Then you can synchronize the
local bibliography submodule by running the following commands:

```sh
git submodule update --remote bibliography
git add bibliography
git commit -m 'Synchronize bibliography'
```

If the remote bibliography repository is broken, you can roll back the bibliography version
in the submodule. For example to go back 4 commits in the past, run:

```sh
cd bibliography/
git reset HEAD~4
git checkout .
cd ..
git add bibliography/
git commit -m 'Roll back to an older version of the bibliography'
```

### How to create a pull request

- Fork this repository
- If you clone your fork locally, run
  ```sh
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  git config --local submodule.recurse true
  ```
- Create your changes in your fork

- You can add DRAFT, or WIP to indicate work-in-progress PRs.
- Add a short description

The community will review your pull request and may ask you for additional changes.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask (we are trying to be as
helpful as possible).

## Publication
We currently have split the topic of teaching RSEs in Germany across four papers.
We aim for a publication of most of these papers.
All people that have participated in discussions with us,
e.g. at deRSE23 or undeRSE23 are at least eligible for contributor status.
If you have participated regularly at our weekly working meetings you are eligible for
authorship.

The first paper,
_Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer_,
is now available as a pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457
