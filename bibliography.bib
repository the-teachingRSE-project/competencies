abstract={Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research, yet significant challenges to discoverability, productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability exist. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which FAIR should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation of the research community to better understand the crucial role of FAIR research software in maximising research value. The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has adapted the FAIR Guiding Principles to create the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). The contents and context of the FAIR4RS Principles are summarised here to provide the basis for discussion of their adoption. Examples of implementation by organisations are provided to share information on how to maximise the value of research outputs, and to encourage others to amplify the importance and impact of this work.},

abstract = 	{Researchers develop software to process or generate data to test their scientific hypotheses. Especially researchers from STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) validate their models through self-developed software prototypes. However, they do not necessarily have a programming or software engineering background. Moreover, scientific software development happens in a time-constrained environment focusing on the fast publication of results. In addition, as scientists usually have limited contracts, the software is developed with short-term goals in mind. Therefore, the resulting software is mostly rapidly developed and contains code artifacts that are hard to maintain, extend and even reproduce due to missing documentation or dependencies. These factors, among others, hinder researchers from progressing and further developing their software. Thus, research software sustainability is vital to the research process to ensure that software can be evolved and reused by the next generation of scientists. To foster sustainability, scientists can highly benefit from education in principles and practices of software engineering, which can further be supported by established methods, tools, and technologies. This paper introduces SURESOFT, a twofold approach to address challenges in the development of research software regarding sustainable science that combines tools and infrastructure with education in the form of workshops and training. Furthermore, we report our experience of applying the SURESOFT approach to five software projects from different fields and discuss challenges, such as common bad practices and applicability in diverse scenarios.},
